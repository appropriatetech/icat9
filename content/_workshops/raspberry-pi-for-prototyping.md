*Goal*: Give an introduction to the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi as a computer, and as a microcontroller board to build “smart” physical projects. Introduce some of the sensors, motors, switches, and other input/output peripherals available, and show how to interact with them through the Raspberry Pi’s general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins. Show participants how to use tools to simulate Raspberry Pi GPIO activity in case they do not have a Raspberry Pi available.

*Pre-requisites*: Participants can follow along on the presenter’s screen, and use software tools to simulate the Raspberry Pi, but participants may get the most out of the session if they can follow along with an actual device. We will provide links to kits that participants can order beforehand, that run anywhere from $30 to $100 USD.
