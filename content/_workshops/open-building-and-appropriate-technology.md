For those unfamiliar with Open Building, please visit this link which will give you a background to the concept: [http://uj-unit2.co.za/open-building-versus-architecture-or-open-building-as-architecture/](http://uj-unit2.co.za/open-building-versus-architecture-or-open-building-as-architecture/). Open Building and Appropriate Technology have many overlaps in terms of the following:

1. Democratising the building process - involving many in the design and implementation process
1. Building as a social process and how to the built environment is based on social structures and relationships
1. The development of small construction enterprises and skills transfer in the construction process
1. Open Building as a tool to manage complexity in the Built Environment ecosystem

We will be hosting several speakers well-known in the field and this will be an interactive session. Register for the Open Building and Appropriate Technology workshop at [http://architectureandagency.co.za/workshop-registration/](http://architectureandagency.co.za/workshop-registration/).
