Mr. Armoogum Parsuramen is a well-known international figure in the field of education, and is the founder and president of the Global Rainbow Foundation in Mauritius, a non-profit organization that is devoted to helping to level the playing field for differently-abled individuals. The organization constructs low-cost prosthetic limbs for those who have lost theirs, offers them associated therapy, and ultimately restores their dignity as fully-functioning members of society.

Mr. Parsuramen has served as Minister of Education, Arts, Culture and Science in Mauritius from 1983 to 1995. He then joined the World Bank (1997-1998) as a “Senior Advisor” in Washington D.C. before taking the post of Director at UNESCO offices in France, Senegal, and India (1998-2011). He has also been conferred an Honorary Doctorate by the Governor of Tamil Nadu and Chancellor of Tamil University for his contributions to the field of education. Mr. Parsuramen is first and foremost, a man of faith and spiritual maturity, he feels a profound gratitude for what he has received in life, and wishes to give back those gifts by serving humanity. In 2019, he was chosen as an ambassador for the Rise & Shine European Union campaign, and was nominated as the Regional Representative for Africa by the Commonwealth of Learning (COL) Board of Governors. Highly humbled by these nominations, Mr. Parsuramen believes that the platforms will allow him to further consolidate his mission to serve the most vulnerable.
