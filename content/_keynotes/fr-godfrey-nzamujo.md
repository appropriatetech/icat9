Father Dr Godfrey Nzamujo is the founder and director of the [_Songhaï Center_]((http://www.songhai.org/index.php/en/home-en)), a pioneering farm, training and research center in Porto-Novo, Benin. Begun in 1985 on a single hectare of land, the Songhaï Center has expanded to at least 17 sites in Africa, including eight in Benin and others in Nigeria, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, among other countries. With the motto 'Commitment to Excellence', Songhaï symbolizes Nzamujo's belief that Africa's ecological characteristics are advantages for a regenerative agricultural and developmental paradigm, rather than impediments.

Father Nzamujo holds doctorates in electrical engineering and in philosophy, advanced specializations in microbiology and in the management sciences, and maintains affiliations with the University of California, Irvine, and Loyola Marymount University as a Professor of Engineering. He was awarded the Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership in 1993, and is the author of two books: _“Songhaï: Quand l’Afrique relève la tête”_ (available in English as _“Songhaï: When Africa lifts up its head”_) and _“Songhaï: l’Afrique maintenant”_. Highly influenced by the Appropriate Technology movement, Father Nzamujo also advances the concept of “Authentic Technology”, which is rooted in a systemic and holistic worldview, rather than a mechanistic one, and is informed by the principles of biomimicry rather than bio-arrogance.
